<h2>An Affordable Master's Degree</h2>

<p class="firstP">The CS Align program is designed to be affordable. Students typically offset tuition by earning $30-$40K while on co-op, serving as TAs and tutors for the college, and taking advantage of a wide range of scholarships. 100 percent of students find employment following graduation. There are many scholarship opportunities available. All applicants are considered for financial aid and scholarship. No separate scholarship application is required.</p>

<p>"As someone who discovered Computer Science after first majoring in English, I wanted to design a new pathway to tech for people who didn’t graduate with a degree in CS. Corporations love diversity of thought and the Align MS in CS allows people to combine their previous background with computer science to become technology leaders in the 21st century."</p>
