<p>Generally, a citizen of a foreign country who wishes to enter the <span>United States must first obtain</span>  a visa, either a nonimmigrant visa for temporary stay or an immigrant visa for permanent residence. Citizens of qualified countries may be able to visit the United States without a visa under the Visa Waiver Program. All travelers coming to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program must obtain authorization through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) system prior to initiating travel to the United States.   If you hold a Canadian passport, please visit the following website at  https://ca.usembassy.gov/visas/ and https://ca.usembassy.gov/visas/do-i-need-a-visa/ for more information.

If you do not qualify for the Visa Waiver Program or are traveling to study, work, participate in an exchange program, or any other purpose that does not fall under a B visa purpose of travel, you will need a nonimmigrant visa.</p>

<p>
A visa does not guarantee entry to the United States. A visa simply indicates that a U.S. consular officer has determined that you are eligible to apply for entry to the United States for a specific purpose.</p>
